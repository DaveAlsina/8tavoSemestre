    "**Method `_fix_orientation` Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identifying the Leftmost Point**:\n",
    "   - The method starts by identifying the leftmost point within the given list of points, which is a crucial reference for determining the orientation of the polygon, this is because the leftmost point is always part of the polygon's convex hull, and by taking a point which is part of the convex hull, we can ensure that the polygon's orientation is consistent and doesn't depend on local concavities, rotations, or other factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Obtaining Index of Leftmost Point in the list of points, and with this get the next and previous points**:\n",
    "   - The index of this leftmost point is recorded for future reference.\n",
    "   - This is achieved by considering the points cyclically, ensuring the indices wrap around the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculating Turn**:\n",
    "   - With the leftmost point, previous point, and next point determined, the method computes the turn using the cross product. This turn calculation indicates whether the polygon is oriented clockwise or counterclockwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adjusting Point Order**:\n",
    "   - If the computed turn indicates a clockwise orientation, it implies that the points are arranged in a clockwise order. To correct this, the method reverses the order of the points, effectively converting a clockwise orientation into a counterclockwise one.\n",
